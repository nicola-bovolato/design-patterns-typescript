# Builder Pattern

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)

In this example [Director](Director.ts) will instruct [SandwichBuilder](Builders.ts) to make different sizes of sandwich.
