# Factory Method Pattern

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)

In this example [VehicleFactory](Factories.ts) will create different types of [Vehicle](Vehicles.ts).
