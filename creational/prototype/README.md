# Prototype Pattern

Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)

In this example [Prototype](Prototype.ts) allows [Rectangle](Prototype.ts) to be cloned.
