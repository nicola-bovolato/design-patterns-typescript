# Abstract Factory Pattern

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)

In this example [RigFactory](Factories.ts) will bundle together a [Case](Cases.ts) and a [Monitor](Monitors.ts) to produce a computer rig.
