# Strategy Pattern

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)

In this example [Sorter](Sorter.ts) allows different types of [SortingStrategy](Strategies.ts).
