# Template Method Pattern

Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method)

In this example [LoggerTemplate](Templates.ts) implements the template method patters.
