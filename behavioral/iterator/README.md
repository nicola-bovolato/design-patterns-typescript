# Iterator Pattern

Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.). [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator)

In this example [UserIterator](Iterators.ts) is used to iterate [UserCollection](Users.ts).
