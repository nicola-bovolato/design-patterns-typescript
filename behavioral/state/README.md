# State Pattern

State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state)

In this example [CarState](States.ts) holds the state of [Car](Car.ts).
