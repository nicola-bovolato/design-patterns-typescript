# Memento Pattern

Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/memento)

In this example [History](History.ts) holds a collection of [Snapshot](Mementos.ts) to restore previous states of [Editor](Editor.ts).
