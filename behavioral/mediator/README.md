# Mediator Pattern

Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator)

In this example [AirTrafficControlMediator](Mediators.ts) is used to coordinate different istances of [Plane](Planes.ts).
