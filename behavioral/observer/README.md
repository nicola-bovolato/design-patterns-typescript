# Observer Pattern

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer)

In this example [Radiostation](RadioStation.ts) notifies multiple instances of [RadioListener](Subscribers.ts) when broadcasting.
