# Command Pattern

Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

In this example [Remote](Remote.ts) uses [Command](Commands.ts) to communicate with [Television](Television.ts).
