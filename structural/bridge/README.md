# Bridge Pattern

Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies (abstraction and implementation) which can be developed independently of each other. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge)

In this example [House](Houses.ts) is the abstraction, and [Garden](Gardens.ts) the implementation.
