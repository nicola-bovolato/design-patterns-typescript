# Facade Pattern

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade)

In this example [FormulaFacade](Decorators.ts) provides a simpler interface to [Formulas.ts](Person.ts).
