# Decorator Pattern

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)

In this example [BaseDecorator](Decorators.ts) decorates [Person](Person.ts) with clothing.
